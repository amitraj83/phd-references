  abstract = {Traditional views of visual processing suggest that early visual neurons
	in areas V1 and V2 are static spatiotemporal filters that extract
	local features from a visual scene. The extracted information is
	then channeled through a feedforward chain of modules in successively
	higher visual areas for further analysis. Recent electrophysiological
	recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal
	that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing
	of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses
	of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early
	visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the
	rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical
	setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian
	inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework,
	the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate
	top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement
	concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We
	suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief
	propagation might model these interactive cortical computations.
	We review some recent neurophysiological evidences that support the
	plausibility of these ideas.},
