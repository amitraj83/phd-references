	perceive a particular attribute added to other features of objects,
	such as form, color, and movement, was fixed during human evolutionary
	lineage as a trait not shared with any great ape. Although prefrontal
	brain expansion is mentioned as responsible for the appearance of
	such human trait, no current knowledge exists on the role of prefrontal
	areas in the aesthetic perception. The visual brain consists of “several
	parallel multistage processing systems, each specialized in a given
	task such as, color or motion” [Bartels, A. & Zeki, S. (1999) Proc.
	R. Soc. London Ser. B 265, 2327–2332]. Here we report the results
	of an experiment carried out with magnetoencephalography which shows
	that the prefrontal area is selectively activated in humans during
	the perception of objects qualified as “beautiful” by the participants.
	Therefore, aesthetics can be hypothetically considered as an attribute
	perceived by means of a particular brain processing system, in which
	the prefrontal cortex seems to play a key role.},

  abstract = {{In this article we present a two dimensional edge detector which
	gives the edge position in an image with a sub-pixel accuracy. The
	method presented here gives an excellent accuracy (the position bias
	mean is almost zero and the standard deviation is less than one tenth
	of a pixel) with a low computational cost, and its implementation
	is very simple since it is derivated from the well-known Non-Maxima
	Suppression method \cite{canny:83,deriche:87}. We also justify the
	method by showing that it gives the exact result in a theoretical
	one dimensional example. We have tested the accuracy and robustness
	of the edge extractor on several synthetic and real images and both
	qualitative and quantitative results are reported in this paper.}},

  year = {2009},
  volume = {7251},
  pages = {72510Q-72510Q-11},
  abstract = {Drip paintings by the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock
	have been analyzed through computer image methods, generally in support
	of authentication studies. The earliest and most thoroughly explored
	methods are based on an estimate of a "fractal dimension" by means
	of box-counting algorithms, in which the painting's image is divided
	into ever finer grids of boxes and the proportion of boxes containing
	some paint is counted. The plot of this proportion (on a log-log
	scale) reveals scaling or fractal properties of the work. These methods
	have been extended in a number of ways, including multifractal analysis,
	where an information measure replaces simple box paint occupancy.
	Recent studies suggest that it is unlikely that any single measure,
	including those based on such box counting, will yield highly accurate
	authentication; for example, a broad class of highly artificial angular
	sketches created in software reveal the same "fractal" properties
	as genuine Pollock paintings. Others have argued that this result
	precludes the value of such fractal-based features for such authentication.
	We show theoretically that even if a visual feature (taken alone)
	is "uninformative," such a feature can enhance discrimination when
	it is combined in a classifier with other features-even if these
	other features are themselves also individually uninformative. We
	describe simple classifiers for distinguishing genuine Pollocks from
	fakes based on multiple features such as fractal dimension, topological
	genus, "energy" in oriented spatial filters, and so forth. We trained
	linear-discriminant and nearest-neighbor classifiers using these
	features and found that our classifiers gave slightly improved recognition
	accuracy on human generated drip paintings. Most importantly, we
	found that although fractal features, taken alone might have low
	discriminative power, such features improved accuracy in multi-feature
	classifiers. We conclude that it is premature to reject the use of
	visual features based on box-counting statistics for the authentication
	of Pollock's dripped works, particularly if such measures are used
	in conjunction with multiple features, machine learning and art material
	studies and connoisseurship.},

	brain correlate with the experience of beauty derived from different
	sources. 21 subjects took part in a brain-scanning experiment using
	functional magnetic resonance imaging. Prior to the experiment, they
	viewed pictures of paintings and listened to musical excerpts, both
	of which they rated on a scale of 1â9, with 9 being the most beautiful.
	This allowed us to select three sets of stimuliâbeautiful, indifferent
	and uglyâwhich subjects viewed and heard in the scanner, and rated
	at the end of each presentation. The results of a conjunction analysis
	of brain activity showed that, of the several areas that were active
	with each type of stimulus, only one cortical area, located in the
	medial orbito-frontal cortex (mOFC), was active during the experience
	of musical and visual beauty, with the activity produced by the experience
	of beauty derived from either source overlapping almost completely
	within it. The strength of activation in this part of the mOFC was
	proportional to the strength of the declared intensity of the experience
	of beauty. We conclude that, as far as activity in the brain is concerned,
	there is a faculty of beauty that is not dependent on the modality
	through which it is conveyed but which can be activated by at least
	two sourcesâmusical and visualâand probably by other sources
	as well. This has led us to formulate a brain-based theory of beauty.</p>

  abstract = {<p>How do external stimuli and our internal state coalesce to create
	the distinctive aesthetic pleasures that give vibrance to human experience?
	Neuroaesthetics has so far focused on the neural correlates of observing
	beautiful stimuli compared to neutral or ugly stimuli, or on neural
	correlates of judging for beauty as opposed to other judgments. Our
	group questioned whether this approach is sufficient. In our view,
	a brain region that assesses beauty should show beauty-level-dependent
	activation during the beauty judgment task, but not during other,
	unrelated tasks. We therefore performed an fMRI experiment in which
	subjects judged visual textures for beauty, naturalness and roughness.
	Our focus was on finding brain activation related to the rated beauty
	level of the stimuli, which would take place exclusively during the
	beauty judgment. An initial whole-brain analysis did not reveal such
	interactions, yet a number of the regions showing main effects of
	the judgment task or the beauty level of stimuli were selectively
	sensitive to beauty level during the beauty task. Of the regions
	that were more active during beauty judgments than roughness judgments,
	the frontomedian cortex and the amygdala demonstrated the hypothesized
	interaction effect, while the posterior cingulate cortex did not.
	The latter region, which only showed a task effect, may play a supporting
	role in beauty assessments, such as attending to one's internal state
	rather than the external world. Most of the regions showing interaction
	effects of judgment and beauty level correspond to regions that have
	previously been implicated in aesthetics using different stimulus
	classes, but based on either task or beauty effects alone. The fact
	that we have now shown that task-stimulus interactions are also present
	during the aesthetic judgment of visual textures implies that these
	areas form a network that is specifically devoted to aesthetic assessment,
	irrespective of the stimulus type.</p>},

	extent to which they are preferred. Variables empirically found to
	predict preference can be analyzed both in terms of their information-processing
	implications and in terms of their evolutionary significance. Some
	of these predictors appear to require fairly extensive information
	processing, thus supporting the hypothesis that a rapid, unconscious
	type of cognition may precede certain affective judgments. Such ties
	between cognition and affect are understandable in the context of
	the proposed theoretical framework for environmental preference.
	This framework not only provides a coherent guide to research but
	also points to the pervasiveness and significance of aesthetics as
	a factor in human behavior and human experience.},

	A geometric analysis of the trellis work in Robert Campin's M{\'e}rode
	Altarpiece}},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {7251},
  pages = {72510R-72510R-9},
  abstract = {A recent theory claims that some Renaissance artists, as early as
	1425, secretly traced optically projected images during the execution
	of some passages in some of their works, nearly a quarter millennium
	before historians of art and of optics have secure evidence anyone
	recorded an image this way. Key evidence adduced by the theory's
	proponents includes the trelliswork in the right panel of Robert
	Campin's Merode altarpiece triptych (c. 1425-28). If their claim
	were verified for this work, such a discovery would be extremely
	important to the history of art and of image making more generally:
	the Altarpiece would be the earliest surviving image believed to
	record the projected image of an illuminated object, the first step
	towards photography, over 400 years later. The projection theory
	proponents point to teeny "kinks" in the depicted slats of one orientation
	in the Altarpiece as evidence that Campin refocussed a projector
	twice and traced images of physically straight slats in his studio.
	However, the proponents rotated the digital images of each slat individually,
	rather than the full trelliswork as a whole, and thereby disrupted
	the relative alignment between the images of the kinks and thus confounded
	their analysis. We found that when properly rotated, the kinks line
	up nearly perfectly and are consistent with Campin using a subtly
	kinked straightedge repeatedly, once for each of the slats. Moreover,
	the proponents did not report any analysis of the other set of slats-the
	ones nearly perpendicular to the first set. These perpendicular slats
	are straight across the break line of the first set-an unlikely scenario
	in the optical explanation. Finally, whereas it would have been difficult
	for Campin to draw the middle portions of the slats perfectly straight
	by tracing a projected image, it would have been trivially simple
	had he used a straightedge. Our results and the lack of any contemporaneous
	documentary evidence for the projection technique imply that Campin
	used a simple mechanical aid-such as a minutely kinked straightedge
	or a mahl stick commonly used in the early Renaissance-rather than
	a very complex optical projector and procedure, undocumented from
	that time.},

  abstract = {Traditional views of visual processing suggest that early visual neurons
	in areas V1 and V2 are static spatiotemporal filters that extract
	local features from a visual scene. The extracted information is
	then channeled through a feedforward chain of modules in successively
	higher visual areas for further analysis. Recent electrophysiological
	recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal
	that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing
	of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses
	of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early
	visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the
	rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical
	setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian
	inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework,
	the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate
	top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement
	concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We
	suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief
	propagation might model these interactive cortical computations.
	We review some recent neurophysiological evidences that support the
	plausibility of these ideas.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an adaptative algorithm for the segmentation of
	color images suited for document image analysis. The algorithm is
	based on a serialization of the k-means algorithm that is applied
	sequentially by using a sliding window over the image. The algorithm
	reuses information about the clusters computed by the previous classification
	and automatically adjusts the clusters during the windows displacement
	in order to better adapt the classifier to any new local modification
	of the colors. For digitized documents, we propose to define several
	different clusters in the color feature space for the same logical
	class. We also reintroduce the user into the initialization step
	who must define the different samples of colors for each class and
	the number of classes. This algorithm has been tested successfully
	on ancient color manuscripts having heavy defects, showing lighting
	variation and transparency. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm
	is generic enough to be applied on a large variety of images using
	other features for different purposes like color image segmentation
	as well as image binarization.},

	a hierarchical tree of nested “modules”? This paper describes an
	interesting complexity measure (based on an information theoretic
	minimum description length principle) which can be used to compare
	two such hierarchical decompositions. This is then used as the fitness
	function for a genetic algorithm (GA) which successfully explores
	the space of possible hierarchical decompositions of a system. The
	paper also describes the novel crosssover and mutation operators
	that are necessary in order to do this, and gives some examples of
	the system in practice. },

	the influence of bottom-up and top-down processes on visual behavior
	while subjects, naÃ¯ve to art criticism, were presented with representational
	paintings. Forty-two subjects viewed color and black and white paintings
	(Color) categorized as dynamic or static (Dynamism) (bottom-up processes).
	Half of the images represented natural environments and half human
	subjects (Content); all stimuli were displayed under aesthetic and
	movement judgment conditions (Task) (top-down processes). Results
	on gazing behavior showed that content-related top-down processes
	prevailed over low-level visually-driven bottom-up processes when
	a human subject is represented in the painting. On the contrary,
	bottom-up processes, mediated by low-level visual features, particularly
	affected gazing behavior when looking at nature-content images. We
	discuss our results proposing a reconsideration of the definition
	of content-related top-down processes in accordance with the concept
	of embodied simulation in art perception.</p>},

@OTHER{Robinson2008,
  abstract = {A recent theory claims that the late-Italian Renaissance painter Lorenzo
	Lotto secretly built a concave-mirror projector to project an image
	of a carpet onto his canvas and trace it during the execution of
	Husband and wife (c. 1543). Key evidence adduced to support this
	claim includes "perspective anomalies" and changes in "magnification"
	that the theory's proponents ascribe to Lotto refocusing his projector
	to overcome its limitations in depth of field. We find, though, that
	there are important geometrical constraints upon such a putative
	optical projector not incorporated into the proponents' analyses,
	and that when properly included, the argument for the use of optics
	loses its force. We used Zemax optical design software to create
	a simple model of Lotto's studio and putative projector, and incorporated
	the optical properties proponents inferred from geometrical properties
	of the depicted carpet. Our central contribution derives from including
	the 116-cm-wide canvas screen; we found that this screen forces the
	incident light to strike the concave mirror at large angles (≥ 15°)
	and that this, in turn, means that the projected image would reveal
	severe off-axis aberrations, particularly astigmatism. Such aberrations
	are roughly as severe as the defocus blur claimed to have led Lotto
	to refocus the projector. In short, we find that the projected images
	would not have gone in and out of focus in the way claimed by proponents,
	a result that undercuts their claim that Lotto used a projector for
	this painting. We speculate on the value of further uses of sophisticated
	ray-tracing analyses in the study of fine arts.},

	still surpasses the best computer vision systems despite decades

	in ultra rapid object categorization and rapid serial visual presentation
	tasks is remarkable. Given the number of processing stages involved
	and typical neural latencies, such rapid visual processing is likely
	to be mostly feedforward. Here we show that a specific implementation
	of a class of feedforward theories of object recognition (that extend
	the Hubel and Wiesel simple-to-complex cell hierarchy and account
	for many anatomical and physiological constraints) can predict the
	level and the pattern of performance achieved by humans on a rapid
	masked animal vs. non-animal categorization task.},

	For works executed in sparse overlapping brush strokes our algorithm
	identifies candidate clusters of brush strokes of the top (most visible)
	layer and digitally removes them. Then, it applies modified inpainting
	algorithms based on statistical structure of strokes to fill in or
	"inpaint" the remaining, partially hidden brush strokes. This processes
	can be iterated, to reveal and fill in successively deeper (partially
	hidden) layers of brush strokes-a process we call "de-picting." Of
	course, the reconstruction of strokes at each successively deeper
	layer is based on less and less image data from the painting and
	requires cascading estimates and inpainting; as such our methods
	yield poorer accuracy and fidelity for such deeper layers. Our current
	software is semi-automatic; the operator such as a curator or art
	historian guides certain steps. Future versions of our software will
	be fully automatic, and estimate more accurate statistical models
	of the brush strokes in the target painting yield better estimates
	of hidden brush strokes. Our software tools may aid art scholars

  abstract = {A large class of diagrams can be informally characterized as node–link
	diagrams. Typically nodes represent entities, and links represent
	relationships between them. The discipline of graph drawing is concerned
	with methods for drawing abstract versions of such diagrams. At the
	foundation of the discipline are a set of graph aesthetics (rules
	for graph layout) that, it is assumed, will produce graphs that can
	be clearly understood. Examples of aesthetics include minimizing
	edge crossings and minimizing the sum of the lengths of the edges.
	However, with a few notable exceptions, these aesthetics are taken
	as axiomatic, and have not been empirically tested. We argue that
	human pattern perception can tell us much that is relevant to the
	study of graph aesthetics including providing a more detailed understanding
	of aesthetics and suggesting new ones. In particular, we find the
	importance of good continuity (ie keeping multi-edge paths as straight
	as possible) has been neglected. We introduce a methodology for evaluating
	the cognitive cost of graph aesthetics and we apply it to the task
	of finding the shortest paths in spring layout graphs. The results
	suggest that after the length of the path the two most important
	factors are continuity and edge crossings, and we provide cognitive
	cost estimates for these parameters. Another important factor is
	the number of branches emanating from nodes on the path.},
